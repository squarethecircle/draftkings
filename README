Variables (need to test)

CHANGE_RANK
WEIGHT
D_PPG Discount Rate



===
Weighted Sum of D_PPG and projection

if player's rank is below threshold and projection higher than D_PPG, use D_PPG
otherwise use the weighted sum of D_PPG and projection

if no PPG, use projection

project.py | get_adjusted_score()

===
Variance penalty

subtract normalized variance from projected score

project.py | get_adjusted_score()

===
Limit exposure to player

-e flag is the maximum allowed number of points per game for player
ie -e is 14 and -i is 15, each player is only allowed to score 14 * 15 = 210 points in total. 
ie if player picked 10 times, the projected score must be below 210 / 10 = 21

default set to 14
